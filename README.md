# lyric-worksheet-converter
This is an automation script I build while working in Japan to help automate a music lesson worksheet creation. It takes a text file containing music lyrics and returns a new modified file such that the first word of each line is follow by empty parenthesis where students can fill in the corresponding english lyrics.
